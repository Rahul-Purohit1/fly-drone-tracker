**Getting Started**  
Prerequisites  
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:  

Node.js (node version : 20.18.0)  
MongoDB (Ensure itâ€™s installed and running locally or use a MongoDB Atlas URL)  

**MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/flydrone**

**Installation**  

Install dependencies, use :   

```bash
npm install 
```

To Run the Application , use :  
**Standard Mode**: 
```bash 
npm run start 
``` 
**Development Mode (with watching)**: 
```bash
npm run start:dev   
```



**Swagger Usage**  

To get the JWT token, call the login API using the example below:  

**Example Request to Obtain JWT Token**  

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:3000/api/users/login' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "email": "example@gmail.com",
  "password": "1234"
}'
```

This will return a JWT token that must be included in the Authorization header as Bearer <token> for all further requests.
